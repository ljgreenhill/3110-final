(**This module contains all the word processing functions specific to
   the stemmer for text*)

val create_units : string -> string
(**[create_units] has all vowels and consonants summarized with either V
   or C*)

val calc_vc : string -> int
(**[calc_vc] is the number of VC pairs. This is the same as m in the
   official porter stemmer paper*)

val remove_plurals : string -> string
(**[remove_plurals] removes the following suffixes: SSES, IES, SS, S.
   This is the same as Step 1a in the official porter stemer paper*)

val remove_past_participles : string -> string
(**[remove_past_particples] removes the following suffixes: EED (if
   there is at least one VC pair), ED (if this leaves at least one vowel
   in the stem), ING (if this leaves at leat one vowel in the stem).
   This is the same as Step 1b in the official porter stemmer paper*)

val finalize_plurals_past_participles : string -> string
(**[finalize_plurals_past_participles] checks if the last 3 characters
   in the stemmed word follow the pattern CVC without grouping. Should
   only be used if remove_plurals or remove_past_participles has altered
   the word*)

val create_simplified_units : string -> string -> string
(**[create_simplified_units] has all vowels and consonants grouped
   together and represented with either V or C*)

val fix_y : string -> string
(**[fix_y] adds and "i" to a stemmed word if it contains a vowel. This
   is Step 1c in the porter stemmer paper*)

val remove_e : string -> string
(**[remove_e] adds "e" to the end of a stemmed word if the number of
   VC's is greater than 1 or the number of VC's is 1 and does not end
   with CVC. This is Step 5a in the porter stemmer paper*)

val check_double_consonant : string -> string
(**[check_double_consonant] removes double consonants from the end of
   stemmed words if the number VC's is greater than 1*)

val apply_finalize : string -> bool
(**[apply_finalize] determines if [finalize_plurals_past_participles]
   should be called based on the result of [remove_past_participles]*)
